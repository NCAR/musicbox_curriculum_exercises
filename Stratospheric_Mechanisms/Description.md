This file includes a series of Stratospheric mechanisms complete with species, reactions, initial conditions, photolysis rates, and evolving conditions.The current existing mechanisms are located along the Equator in the Pacific Ocean (125W 0.42N) Each file has the mechanism altitude (eg. 30km_Strat_Mechanism). As the mechanism becomes more complex, the initial conditions in MusicBox need to be altered. This can be completed in the GUI.  Within each of these files, there are instructions for further help on simplification of the mechanism. Each of the altitude files will contain a zip file that can be downloaded to your computer to be used in MusicBox. Each zip file should contain a config.json, reactions.json, species.json, and tolerance.json.
