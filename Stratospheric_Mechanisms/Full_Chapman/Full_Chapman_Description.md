The Full Chapman Mechanism includes all of the reactions in the Chapman Mechanism in a more complex form than the Simple_Chapman mechanism. The mechanisms are provided at varying altitudes of 20, 30, 40, and 50km. Each altitude has a zip file within that can be simplified down to a simple Ox chemistry. The mechanism provides needed species and complete reactions, intial conditions and evolving diurnal photolysis rates.
